# 07162020-EmployeeDirectory

* Since we have been talking about 'test driven development', I thought that starting with the tests would be appropriate.

- In Employee.test.js, the first test was confirming that Employee is set as an object.
- Next, the test confirmed that the name, id, and email could all be set through the constructor arguments.  I interpret this as the RPG game, where we can create a new instance of Character 'const Ben = new Character("Ben","Programmer",37,100,1000)'
- The test also confirmed that we can get the name, id, and email through the methods set in the constructor --- getName(), getId(), getEmail().
- The test finally confirms that getRole() shows that all employees are classified as employees.

- The other tests confirm that data can be set correctly and retrieved as expected.

* I also used the ReadMeInstructions as a guide.
